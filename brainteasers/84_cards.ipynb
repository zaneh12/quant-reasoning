    "# 84 Cards (IMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a game, there is a deck of 84 distinct cards, each labeled 1 to 84. A dealer shuffles the deck and deals the top 5 cards. If they are in strictly ascending or strictly descending order, the player wins a payout of $x$; otherwise, they win nothing.\n",

    "> **Note:** The number 84 is a red herring. Since the cards are drawn uniformly at random, **only the relative order** of the 5 drawn cards matters â€” not their actual values. This would be identical if there were a million cards. The key is that **only 2 of the 120 possible orderings** are strictly increasing or decreasing.\n",
