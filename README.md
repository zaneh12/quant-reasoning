# quant-reasoning

A collection of brainteasers, mental math drills, probability puzzles, and technical intuition problems relevant to quantitative trading, research, and risk roles.

## What’s Included

This repo helps build speed and clarity for quant interviews — especially when working without paper.

### Core Topics

- **Brainteasers** – logic puzzles, boxes & coins, Monty Hall-type setups
- **Expected Value** – payout structures, EV vs variance, hidden probabilities
- **Bayes Theorem** – posterior updating, diagnostic tests, reasoning under uncertainty
- **Linear Algebra** – projections, positive semidefiniteness, eigen-intuition
- **Option Math** – greeks, BSM intuition, binomial model, payoff structure
- **Probability Theory** – distributions, independence, Markov chains, rare events
- **Stats & Inference** – estimators, hypothesis testing, confidence logic
- **Trees & Recursion** – path sums, DFS reasoning, binary structure logic
- **Market Structure** – order books, bid-ask spreads, liquidity fragmentation

## Goal

Building and reinforcing mental models for interview-ready patterns. Obviously in short time, no calculator no code. (but will be implementations in python for practice too!)
